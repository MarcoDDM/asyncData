      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      This was an application made for practice purposes. Although it is not a real "product", 
      it works completely and does what it is supposed to do.

      You register, you write a message that you want to be sent post mortem.

      Every x amount of time, the system writes you an email which you must confirm with a click. 
      If you do not confirm it, the system assumes that you are dead and sends that message to those 
      who you configured yourself to receive it. 

      I am currently looking for a job as an employee. If you think that my skills can be useful to your organization, you can contact me through linkedin, where you can see more details.
